 Hi this is my starting out point for getting started with building generative AI resources natively in classical Latin. The website at https://www.latinalinguamachina.com/ I have a newsletter in Latin and we are building a chatgot clone for Latin learners and a social network.`

For now this repository is going to be a grab bag of tools for Large Language Models in classical Latin I will be building. 

I hope to build or contribute towards a Large Language Model specifically made for Classical Latin. I expect to insert all of the available classical literature and vocabulary from open source sources. 

All software in this repository is by Latina Lingua Machina LLC under the GPL 3.0 unless otherwise stated.ee
