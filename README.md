Placeholder repo for https://www.latinalinguamachina.com/

For now this repository is going to be a grab bag of tools for Large Language Models in classical Latin I will be building. 

I hope to build or contribute towards a Large Language Model specifically made for Classical Latin. I expect to insert all of the available classical literature and vocabulary from open source sources.
