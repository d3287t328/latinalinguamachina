 Hi this is my starting out point for getting started with building generative AI resources natively in classical Latin. The website at https://www.latinalinguamachina.com/ I have a newsletter in Latin and we are building a chatgot clone for Latin learners and a social network.`

For now this repository is going to be a grab bag of tools for Large Language Models in classical Latin I will be building. 

I hope to build or contribute towards a Large Language Model specifically made for Classical Latin. I expect to insert all of the available classical literature and vocabulary from open source sources. 

== Project Goals ==

1. PDF chat bot service based on https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain
2. Latin wikipedia chatbot based on https://twitter.com/StephanSturges/status/1651567091051372549
3. Dedicated web client
4. Under consideration: Mightynetworks chatbot.

All software in this repository is released by Latina Lingua Machina LLC under the GPL 3.0 unless otherwise stated.
