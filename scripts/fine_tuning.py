# In this script, the fine_tuning.py script loads a pre-trained language model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library, and fine-tunes the model on a domain-specific or task-specific dataset. The train_file variable should point to the path of the training data, which can be either a single text file (in which case the LineByLineTextDataset is used) or a directory containing multiple text files (in which case the TextDataset is used).
# The script sets up the training arguments using the TrainingArguments class, which specifies the output directory for the fine-tuned model, the number of training epochs, the batch size, and other hyperparameters. The DataCollatorForLanguageModeling class is used to batch and pad the input data, and the Trainer class is used to handle the actual training process.
# In the example usage, the script fine-tunes the pre-trained GPT-2 model on the training data for one epoch using the default hyperparameters. You can experiment with different hyperparameters and training data by modifying the arguments passed to TrainingArguments and Trainer, respectively.
# Note that this is just an example, and you may want to modify the script to suit your specific use case. For example, you may want to include additional layers or modules in the model, use a different optimizer or learning rate schedule, or evaluate the fine-tuned model on a validation or test set.
