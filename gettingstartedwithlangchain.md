To get started with LangChain, you will first need to install Python and pip on your system. Once you have done that, you can follow these steps:


Clone the LangChain repository to your local machine using the git clone command.

Navigate to the cloned directory using the cd command.

Install the required Python packages using the pip install -r requirements.txt command.

Create a new directory for your LLM project.

Copy the contents of the examples directory in the LangChain repository to your new project directory.

Modify the grammar.ll file in your project directory to define your classical Latin grammar.

Modify the main.py file in your project directory to specify the input and output files for your LLM.

Run the main.py file using the python main.py command.

This should get you started with using LangChain to build a new LLM in classical Latin. Good luck!
